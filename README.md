# HR Analytics Dashboard - Power BI Project

This repository contains a **HR Analytics Dashboard** created using **Power BI**. The project aims to help companies analyze employee attrition and identify key factors contributing to employee turnover. The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle**, and the dashboard provides insights into attrition across different demographics and departments.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Downloaded the HR dataset from **Kaggle**.
   - Cleaned the data using **Excel** and **Power BI**, removing unnecessary information.
   
2. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Created a **Power BI dashboard** with various KPIs and visualizations to track key metrics related to employee attrition.
   
3. **Analysis**: 
   - Analyzed attrition across various factors including department, age, education, salary, and years at the company.

### Key Features

- **Toggle Switch for Departments**:
   - Switch between different departments: **HR**, **Research and Development**, and **Sales**.
   
- **KPIs and Metrics**:
   - **Employee Count**: Total number of employees in each department.
   - **Attrition Count**: Number of employees who have left the company.
   - **Attrition Rate**: Percentage of employees who have left the company.
   - **Average Age**: Average age of employees.
   - **Average Salary**: Average salary of employees.
   - **Average Years in Company**: Average years employees have spent in the company.

- **Charts**:
   - **Attrition by Age**: Displayed as a double bar chart.
   - **Attrition by Education**: Displayed in a donut chart.
   - **Attrition by Department**: Attrition breakdown by department.
   - **Attrition by Salary**: Analysis of attrition based on salary levels.
   - **Attrition by Years at Company**: Attrition rates based on years spent at the company.
   - **Attrition by Gender**: Breakdown of attrition based on gender.
   - **Employee Ratings**: A chart displaying ratings given by employees.

### Insights Provided by the Dashboard

The dashboard helps companies analyze:
- **Why employees are leaving** by looking at factors such as age, education, department, salary, and years spent at the company.
- **Which department** experiences the highest attrition rates.
- **Correlation between employee satisfaction (ratings)** and attrition.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: Used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Excel**: Used for initial data cleaning.
- **Kaggle**: Data source for the HR dataset.
